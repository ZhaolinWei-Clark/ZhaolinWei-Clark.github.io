<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my 15-year swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

## Music

<br>There must be something truly magical about performing on the stage.
